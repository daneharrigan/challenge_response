ChallengeResponse
=================

A challenge response plugin for Rails. This is to be used instead of a CAPTCHA. Questions like "What does 1 + 2 equal?", "What letter comes before W?", "What does 7 - 3 equal?" will be asked and tested.

Instructions
=================

1. Add plugin

2. Run "script/generate challenge_response"

3. Review the questions and answers in: vendor/plugins/challenge_response/challenge_questions.yml
3a. If questions are not acceptable run "script/generate challenge_response redo"

4. Migrate the database, "rake db:migrate"

5. Add the following to the controller that needs the challenge response:

  class YourController < ApplicationController
    include ChallengeResponse

    before_filter :challenge_response, :only => [:index, :create]
    ...
  end

  def create # this code is to be applied to your existing create method
    if params[:form] and challenge_successful?
      ...
    else
      create_challenge # creates a new challenge question entry
      ...
    end
  end

The challenge_response method is being processed on the "new" controller method to generate the question.
It is also running on the "create" controller method to validate the question.

The challenge_successful? method will return a true or false value determining whether or not the response was valid.
The response may be valid, but other areas of the form were not. In a case like this you see the create_challenge method being used. This will create a new challenge for the user. 

6. Add the following to the view. The HTML in this example is hypothetical and should be changed to fit the view properly:
  <div>
    <p><%= challenge_question %></p>
    <%= challenge_answer_tag %>
  </div>

7. Play clean up. Use ChallengedSession.sweep("20min") to remove any unused entries. This can happen if a person views the form and leaves without submitting.
