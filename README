ChallengeResponse
=================

A challenge response plugin for Rails. This is to be used instead of a Captcha. Questions like "What does 1 + 2 equal?", "What letter comes before W?", "What does 7 - 3 equal?" will be asked and tested.

Instructions
=================

1. Add plugin

2. Run "script/generate challenge_response"

3. Review the questions and answers in: vendor/plugins/challenge_response/challenge_questions.yml
3a. If questions are not acceptable run "script/generate challenge_response redo"

4. Migrate the database, "rake db:migrate"

5. Add the following to the controller that needs the challenge response:
  before_filter :challenge_response, :for => [:new, :create]

  def create # this code is to be applied to your existing create method
    if params[:form] and challenge_successful?
      ...
    else
      create_challenge # creates a new challenge question entry
      ...
    end
  end

6. Add the following to the view. The HTML in this example is hypothetical and should be changed to fit the view properly:
  <div>
    <p><%= challenge_question %></p>
    <%= text_field_tag :challenge_answer %>
  </div>
